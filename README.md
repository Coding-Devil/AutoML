# 🧠 **Auto-ML : Meta-Modal Distributed ML Framework** 🚀

Welcome to the **Meta-Modal Distributed Machine Learning Framework**, a next-gen solution for scaling **tabular** and **image data** models using cutting-edge tools like **PyTorch Lightning**, **Ray Tune**, and advanced **distributed computing** methodologies. This repository is designed for developers and researchers alike, offering powerful scalability and streamlined automation for your machine learning pipelines. 💡

## 🌐 **Overview**

This project focuses on building, training, and deploying a **multi-modal ML model** that integrates **tabular** and **image inputs**. It is built for **scalability** using distributed training techniques, enabling rapid development even for large datasets. It’s perfect for anyone looking to explore **hyperparameter tuning**, **model compression**, and **scalable deployment**.

### ✨ **Highlights**

- **Multi-Modal Data Processing**: Combines image and tabular data for more insightful predictions.
- **Distributed Scalability**: Powered by PyTorch Lightning’s **DDP (Distributed Data Parallel)** to scale training across multiple devices.
- **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning**: Efficient tuning via **Ray Tune** for better model performance.
- **Optimized for Deployment**: Supports **model compression** for deployment on low-resource environments.
- **Future-Ready Architecture**: Easily extendable for real-world large-scale applications.

## 🔧 **Installation and Setup**

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/multi-modal-ml.git
cd multi-modal-ml
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Ensure you have the necessary packages installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Dependencies include*: `torch`, `torchvision`, `pytorch-lightning`, `ray`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `pillow`.

### Step 3: Prepare the Data

Organize your datasets:
- **Tabular Data**: Should be in CSV format and ready for preprocessing.
- **Images**: Images should be placed in a well-structured directory.

## 🏗️ **How to Use**

### Dataset Preparation

- Ensure your **tabular data** is preprocessed and structured correctly.
- Modify the `MultiModalDataset` class in the scripts if necessary to fit your data format.

### Training

Run **single-device training**:

```bash
python scripts/train_single.py
```

Or for **distributed training**:

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=<number_of_devices> scripts/train_distributed.py
```

### Hyperparameter Tuning

To perform distributed **hyperparameter tuning** with **Ray Tune**:

```bash
python scripts/hyperparam_tune.py
```

### Model Compression & Deployment

Run the following script to compress and save your trained model for efficient deployment:

```bash
python scripts/compress_and_save.py
```
